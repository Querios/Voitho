# Voitho
A cross - platform mobile app dedicated to connecting people who need help with people who volunteer to offer it. It's easy to use, authentication with local authorities and many more features.

# Inspiration
An article I read about two teenagers who did the daily shopping for elderly people in their neighborhood so that they didn't have to leave their homes during this pandemic. The word "Voitho" means "helping" in greek.
 
# What it does
It offers a way for people to express their need for help in their daily lives, a way for people to express their desire to volunteer for solving other people's problems and a way for both of them to get in touch with each other. 

# How I built it
It has been made completely in Visual Studio by using Xamarin, which allowed me to build the app for Android, iOS and UWP devices without the need to write three different types of codes . 

# Challenges I ran into
Mostly time, since I found out this challenge in the middle of this week and had little time to prepare. Other than that, challenges included both finding ways to motivate people into taking the initiative and start using the app, preventing malicious people from misusing the app (both volunteers and requesters), protecting both the users' sensitive and personal data and connecting this app to one of the platforms used by authorities, in order to validate the identity of each individual.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Taking the initiative to join this hackathon and becoming a part of people working together to help make the world a better place. 

# What I learned
I learned that there are more people in this world that are willing to put effort into making this world a better place. I also learned how many security issues these kind of apps have.

# What's next for Voitho
First and foremost, online functionality. Then, getting in touch with authorities, at first the local ones, in order to help with the identification of each user and ensuring the security of each individual's data. Afterwards, the ability for requesters and volunteers to communicate with one another through in - app messages. Other ideas also include a ranking system with a leaderboard, where users can compare their accomplishments with one another and a social network where users can create uniques teams Another idea is the implementation of a security system that will let requesters book money for the volunteers, who will be spending the money out of their pockets until the completion of the request.
